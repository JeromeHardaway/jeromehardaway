I am Jerome Hardaway, Google Developer Expert, Twilio Champion, Developer Evangelist, Content Creator, Comic Nerd and Executive Director of Vets Who Code. I love my work of helping veterans writing code, and putting a dent in the universe using one of my many Captain America Shields. Hope you see this and it inspires you to become your best version then 10X it.
