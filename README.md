I am Jerome Hardaway, Google Developer Expert, Twilio Champion, Developer Evangelist, Content Creator, Comic Nerd and Executive Director of Vets Who Code. My life goal is to be the first POTUS that actually knows how to write Javascript and to me the country a truly data and empathy driven utopia, where everything can be proven regardless of feelings. I love my work of helping veterans writing code, and putting a dent in the universe using one of my many Captain America Shields. Hope you see this and it inspires you to become your best version then 10X it.
